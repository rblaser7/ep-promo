                    Ryan Blaser is an up-and-coming artist from Phoenix, AZ. He was formerly
                    a member of the band BDBO, but has since gone solo, looking to shift his 
                    style. Since then, he has produced three albums, including his newest EP 
                    the Epitome of Productivity. Ryan is a prolific songwriter, an inspired 
                    audio engineer, and an accomplished musician. The tracks for each of the 
                    instruments and vocals recorded were done by Ryan himself. Check out some 
                    of his music in the <a href="music.html">Music</a> section!
